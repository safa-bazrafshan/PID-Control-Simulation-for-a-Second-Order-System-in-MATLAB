## Overview
This project demonstrates the design, simulation, and analysis of a PID controller for a second-order linear system using MATLAB. It includes manual PID tuning, auto-tuning, and testing the system's behavior under different conditions such as step inputs, disturbances, and sinusoidal signals.

## Objectives
- Understand PID controller design principles.
- Improve system performance (rise time, settling time, overshoot).
- Analyze open-loop vs closed-loop behavior.
- Demonstrate response to different input types.

## Tools Used
- MATLAB (Control System Toolbox)
- Transfer Function Modeling
- Time-Domain and Frequency-Domain Analysis

## Files
- pid_simulation.m: Main MATLAB script for all simulations.
- plots/: Folder containing all simulation result figures.
